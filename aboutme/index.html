    <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints for almost 21 years, my favorite qoute from the Prophet Russell M. Nelson, I quote, Love and care for your wife, become one with her, be her partner, make it easy for her to want to be yours, No other interest in life should take priority over building an eternal relationship with her.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is from Doctrine and Covenant 130:18-19. whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his deligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.</p>
